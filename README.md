# Jump and Run

A side scrolling game where you play as a black cat looking for a home in the deserts of Arizona. Avoid the incoming obstacles on the way.

## Optimizations:

With more time I want to make sure there is an end to the level. To take it a step further I have plans to add another two levels, a pause button, local storage for keeping track of high scores, and a character selection screen.

## Lessons Learned:

As a big gamer I have played a lot of platformer games and I wanted to give a side scroller a try. This game is a combination of flappy bird and the Google T-rex side scroller. PLaying with the clearInterval()/setInterval() and clearTimeout()/setTimeout() to move the obstacles was a fun challenge to get the gameplay loop to feel satisfying. This was a fun way to learn how to make a game using nothing but a little html, some CSS, and a bit more JS.
